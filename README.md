webdev-setup
============

A simple script to setup ubuntu for php-web-development.

Its no magic, it just uses all install commands from DaRaffs gist: https://gist.github.com/3995789

During the script it will stop from time to time to ask you for settings.
After running the script, look at the gist and configure the services you just installed.

There are two flavours of the script:
* installDevEnvironmentApache.sh does the setup with Apache
* installDevEnvironmentNginx.sh does the setup with Nginx
